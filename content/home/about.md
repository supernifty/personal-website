# Biography

I am a bioinformatician employed at [Melbourne Bioinformatics](http://www.melbournebioinformatics.org.au/). 

I am currently involved with a number of applied research projects at Melbourne Bioinformatics. These include:

* [Melbourne Genomics Health Alliance](http://www.melbournegenomics.org.au/), a consortium bringing genomics to the clinic.
* [Human Genomics Group](https://www.melbournebioinformatics.org.au/project/human-genomics/), a group focussed on applying novel approaches to large scale data-analytics problems.
* The [Pan Prostate Genomics Consortium](https://www.melbournebioinformatics.org.au/project/ppgc/), a project to analyse a large cohort of WGS prostate cancer samples across numerous collaborating institutions.

I have an ongoing interest in genomics, particularly cancer genomics, statistical methods, and machine learning.

My background prior to bioinformatics is software engineering.
I ran a software consulting company that developed a variety of mobile and web apps. See [Supernifty](http://www.supernifty.org/) for further details.
